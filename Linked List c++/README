Contents:
a doubly linked list with the following functionalities:
1. insert at front
2. print
3. sort (using the merge sort algorithm)

problems:
1. no delete functionality as of yet
2. no insert an N functionality
3. when applying merge sort, lose track of one of the pPrev pointers and breaks the backwards link.

plans (11/21):
1. add deletion
2. add insert at N
